# Readable for BlaBlaCar

With launch of the "new" BlaBlaCar the designers marginally modified the design of the website with new colors, a new icon and a new font. As this font is hard to read at least on my monitor because of its glyphs and size used on the website, this addon hooks into the website and removes it out of every element.

The addon is created for Firefox and was tested on v57.0.2 on Windows.
